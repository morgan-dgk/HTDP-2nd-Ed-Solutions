# How To Design Programs 2nd Ed. Solutions

My solutions to the exercises from the 2nd edition of [How To Design Programs](https://htdp.org/). 

This text introduces a systematic way of understanding, analysing, and writing computer programs. It is aimed at professional programmers as well as a more general audience.

Exercises to reinforce learning are intended to be solved in Racket, a modern dialect of Lisp.
